",,,,,We have done a good job so far in distributing workload and taking advantage of the abilities of each member.,"So far, work has been good. I think our initial brainstorming session for the final project could have been better. We got excited about an idea and made that decision a little quickly.

Our final project concept is a combination of our several ideas, which will allow for a more cohesive design process.","One of our teammates has been a little distant. For example, they did not show up to a non-mandatory brainstorming session, which decreased team unity slightly.

35,"Our shared goal for our work together was to create the best possible product, whether it be a lab report, an assignment, or our actual final project, as efficiently as possible.",,,,,"I think that our team was strongest whenever we were in the same place, both physically and mentally. When we were locked on and all on the same page, we were able to assess correctly our team's strengths and weaknesses, and were able to delegate accordingly. Each individual was eager to pull his or her own weight and help the team in whatever capacity they could. ","In general, I think there were some moments where communication could be improved. Response times could occasionally be undesirable, although we always managed to band together and pull through when appropriate. ","Our team did have some attendance issues, which was okay but ultimately led to some unfortunate complications down the line, particular in terms of communication. Making the effort for each individual to be at lab and whenever we meet outside of lab would be a great way to make sure those small hiccups do not happen.",,,,,,,
35,We had a goal to finish Lab 2 (designing the wheel) by Monday night,,,,,"we communicated very well with each other, and people took charge of responsibilities on their own without having to force anyone to get their work done.

38,I do not think that we verbally agreed on a shared goal but I think that we all agreed to finish all the work on time.,,,,,"What goes well when our team works together is that we discuss our ideas and help each other out to solve the tasks. For example, some of us worked collaboratively on the last lab and we each did a part to make sure that the report was finished. ",I think that what could have gone better is if we started working on assignments earlier to have more time to discuss and see what needs to get done. I feel that we left the last assignment towards the last day so it was a little rushed.,I feel that what we could do differently is to make a group chat with all our team members. We ended up doing that this last week and it should facilitate the team work and making sure that everyone is aware of what needs to be done and make sure that everyone is doing something and not letting just a couple members do all the work. Also making sure that we reread the lab description to make sure that we are answering all the questions that are being asked on the report.,,,,,,,
