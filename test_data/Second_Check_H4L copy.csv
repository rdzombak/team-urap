TeamName,Shared Goal,,"Degree of goal alignment  (1 = lo, 5 = hi)","Degree of goal development (1 = lo, 5 = hi)",Notes,What is going well in your team's work together?,What could go better?,What might the team do differently to make things go better?
1,Stop the fire,,2,3,,We are able to cover for each other when one falls behind. We all reach out to contact people independently. ,"Because now everthing moves really fast, a lot of conversations are happening, so we need time to sit down and digest. ",Sit down to brainstorm strategy on how to contact key beneficiaries for our product. 
1,Yes. Our shared goal is to make a real impact in reducing fire risk by the end of the semester by delivering a completed product of some sort by the end of the semester,,,,,"Communication, and understanding. We are all on the same page in where we are in our project, and we are all dedicated to producing a successful outcome. We are also very good at picking up for each other when someone has a particularly stressful week.","At our best, we are a great team and we work together very well. When one of us has a stressful weak, we are great at making up the work. But when all of us have stressful weeks, we don't have mechanisms to offer us leeway. We have the next week to make up for that though, but it's still a rough experience.","We might start using the HIPPO organizational method, and be prepared for stressful weeks before hand by looking at our calendars and planning out for future midterms or projects and such."
1,Make sure we are on the same page,,,,,We are all very respectful of each other's time and willing to pick up each other's slack when needed and do beyond what is assigned to us,We need more follow-through on what we commit to do.,"Somehow be more true to our commitments.  When we commit to something, do it, and if we want to explore something different, let our team know we want to go in a different direction before doing so."
2,"I think we have started to define our goal a little bit better than what it was earlier in the semester. I believe that our goal is to create a platform that connects the musings of community members to developers and city officials in an easy to digest, yet effective way.",,3,3,,"We have started melding our ideas together and we have started to work on what an MVP would look like. At this point, I am excited to actually have a product as opposed to just talking about the issues constantly",I still think communication could go a little bit better as well as delegation of tasks. I applaud Ben for taking over that HiPPO role that we talked about in class. He has really helped the group stay on track and complete various tasks in recent weeks.,"I think that not everyone has to take a direct planning and organizational role, but I think that as a team we could all take a little bit more charge in owning certain tasks."
2,To increase transparency between developers and community members,,,,,research into discovering new causes and solutions to the problem,We do not exactly communicate and listen to others very well,Allowing space for all sides to be heard and be considered in the decision making process
2,Yes. The goal is promoting social equity--making decisions with collective impacts be more influenced by the needs of marginalized populations.,,,,,Structured routine.,Time spent doing face-to-face discussions is very productive. Could use much more of it.,Spend more time discussing subject matter.
2,"Yes, to develop a web platform to help bring transparency in the real estate project design/implementation process in Oakland",,,,,Everyone seems to be getting better at understanding the core of the issue,Everyone's equal participation and energy in making the final leg of the project a success,Take more ownership of tasks and more initiatives
3,Yes. Working with the community in South Berkeley and empower them to get involved in actively solving their health problems,,3,3,,"Our team work, energy, commitment to the project  ",organisation of the way we work,Going back to digesting interview insights collectively like we did in the past
3,"Yes, to create a health innovation workshop for the South Berkeley community.",,,,,"Our new meeting system has helped us become more organized. Also, we have become more transparent with each other, so we understand what is going on when someone is not being responsive.",We need to have better fail safes for how we can procure interviews during busy times of the semester.,Find ways to make interviews shorter and more direct while still maintaining an air of connection between both parties.
3,"Yes, to survive and complete the course :)",,,,,"Openness to new ideas, and a good dose of debate on the issues and directions to pursue as a team. Also been impressed by the level of commitment shown to the project",Wish we could squeeze in another discussion session on strategy and findings but we are all busy at this stage of the semester.,
4,Yes. A project that we all feel strongly about and a final deliverable product.,,4,4,,"After a semester with a large amount of frustration, we feel strongly about the project we are working on now.",Faster movement with less effort.,Generating tasks for each other more; holding each other accountable to those tasks. 
4,"Yes. We want to create a creative empathy building platform in the form of a podcast showcasing the stories of the homeless. I think we have different ideas of how far we can realistically take it in the course of four weeks, but I think we have all agreed on an MVP in the form of a short recording that would be a part of a longer podcast. ",,,,,"We have pretty good communication, and a lot of interest from each individual member. We are receptive of everyone's ideas.","Again, presentations aren't started soon enough. There isn't much discussion in the days leading up to the presentation due to everyone's busy schedules. ","I think the team should stick to the time for group meetings, and maybe have additional meetings the weekend before. It is difficult, however, to finish the presentations before Wednesday as we usually have insights/interviews up till Wednesday night. Better communication over online platforms would help facilitate this the evening of."
4,Our shared goal is to develop a podcast that will broadcast homeless people's in an effort to spark empathy and direct action. ,,,,,Our team is able to bounce ideas back and forth pretty well.,Responsiveness and completing interview analyses/presentations earlier,Communicate more often and work on presentations earlier
5,No clear goal,,3,3,,A sub-group of the team seems to constantly deliver,More commitment. Team morale is low -people don't expect much from the course anymore. There is no passion for the problem-,"At this stage in the course, it would be interesting to have one session with Rachel and Steve and create a team plan from the end result to the current week. The team wants to deliver, but the path is still blurry. There are too many different opinions, feedback from professors is too general. We need to come as a group with a clear plan to execute in the next 3-4 weeks."
5,Increase ridership on AC Transit buses,,,,,Resources available to approach the problem,Participation from team members,Commit more to this class and not make it least priority compared to other courses
5,Unfortunately I am not sure,,,,,Everybody is friendly and openminded,We can better organize the work done as a team. We can also commit more time to the project as a team,I would go for more fixed processes.
5,Yes. To increase ridership of AC Transit. Also to work as a team and not an individual,,,,,Team members step up whenever needed,Equal contribution from all. Not waiting till last moment to get things done.,Plan early and then execute
5,Yes; our goal is to boost the ridership of the AC Transit,,,,,We had interviews from a variety of people and attended the AC Transit board meeting.,"More effective communication about the ""next steps.""",Set clear goals and expectation every time we have meetings/interviews.
