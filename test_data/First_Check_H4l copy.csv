TeamName,Shared Goal,,"Degree of goal alignment  (1 = lo, 5 = hi)","Degree of goal development (1 = lo, 5 = hi)",Notes,What is going well in your team's work together?,What could go better?,What might the team do differently to make things go better?,,,,,,,
1,"I think to our goal is to contribute our fair share to the team. To this point, it is getting as much interviews as possible. ",,2,3,,I think we are respectful of each other opinion and time. ,We have a lot of difficulty setting out a team outside of class to talk and prep for thursday presentation,Setting out a team to digest all the information being thrown at us. ,,,,,,,
1,Yes. Do reduce fire damage in the East Bay and possibly in California.,,,,,"We are gathering good data and information, we are making progress in discovery in the problems, and we are sharing work well. We have a shared mutual respect for each other","We could have better communication. When we are able to meet up, we are able to have very productive conversations, but when we don't it is often difficult for us to be on the same page. We could also figure out where to focus more, and clarify our direction.",We might meet up or call more just to talk about learned insights and figure out direction.,,,,,,,
1,"We do not have an explicitly stated shared goal, but I think implicitly our shared goal is to find our answer to the ""How Might We"" question we have posed for Mitigating Fire Vulnerability",,,,,We have fairly open channels of communication,We could do a bit better at clear division of responsibilities,"We need to check in together with each other earlier on.  Though it is hard to find a time to ""reset"" and plan ahead as it's been ""go-go-go"" from the start",,,,,,,
2,"It's hard to define what our team goals are. We all do our individual work alongside the weekly expectations for the course, but I don't think we have really defined a long term goal for the project. Hopefully as we move forward into the solutions part of the course we will be able to define our goals for this project more clearly.",,2,3,,Everyone does the work they claim. there has not been any issues with people claiming workstreams and then not following through which I guess is a positive.,"I really wish we met as a team more often. We all have time available early in the week, but due to not wanting to be on campus at night, we do not meet apart from for 45-60 minutes on Wendesday and on Thursday afternoons after class. I find it difficult to define new workflows for the week directly after class, so I wish we were able to meet at a separate time during the week to make sure we are all on the same page. Right now, most of our communication is via the team slack channel which is good for some things, but it definitely does not replace face to face interaction which is something I think our team lacks.",I'm hoping we are able to meet as a team more often as well as earlier in the week.,,,,,,,
2,To determine the best solution to our problem for all those involved,,,,,Everyone is gathering great insights from our research,Better communication of our findings ,Better communication between team members about insights from interviews and readings ,,,,,,,
2,Yes: we want to figure out what's wrong presently that's keeping equitable developments from happening. Then come up with ways to alleviate those factors.,,,,,We all have background related to the subject. Teamates' areas of interest also matches the topic.,"Firt is more communication, either through enthusiasm or routine check-ins. Regardless, we need to have a higher group online presence on Slack. Which also brings up the second point: faster turnaround. We all have classes but the turn-around rate can take more than a few hours before the 1st response. A more responsive and committedness would be great. Third is knowledge sharing. We currently have a speadsheet of tasks and leads, but no shared documents of new insights. New insights usually go into the group chat, which is inconvenient to go through. ",Re-organize information sharing to have better updates of new insights from teammates. In addition we should set clearer agendas for each members at the start of each week to have a clearer idea of everyone's deliverables.,,,,,,,
2,To create a lean tool/method to mainstream equitable development in real estate projects.,,,,,Some of us are very excited about the project and are working with great energy on it. It is fun to see different perspectives on the same thing because people are thinking about it on their own.,"Fair work-share, regular communication",Individuals need to take more initiatives to take up work and better communication. ,,,,,,,
3,"Yes. We all converge towards the goal of identifying a significant health challenge in South Berkeley and coming up with a solution that rather than being a quick fix, will addresses the root causes to the health issue and have a positive and long lasting impact.",,3,3,,"Our team dynamics. The team offers a space for everybody's ideas, and we are all always accommodating of one another's time and needs. We have fun working on the problem together.",Coordination. We had not been doing a good job at bringing our different together and coming up with a common meaning but we started doing that now.,"Coordinate better. In addition to meeting to put together the presentation, have prior meetings focusing only on getting our insights from our combined interviews",,,,,,,
3,"Yes; we are working toward ""Improving health in South Berkeley.""",,,,,"When we are able to meet up, we are able to disseminate information and come up with insights in a timely and productive manner.","Outside of times during which we are together, I would contact my group members and would not receive replies back for up to 24 hours.",The main thing I would like from my group members is to have more robust remote communication.,,,,,,,
3,We did but I have forgotten what it was.  We are all looking to learn new skills and have a solid project to include in our resume,,,,,Willingness to step out and conduct interviews,"Communication and discussions.  We are all super busy, and have the smallest team, so if something comes up we need to tackle this.",The shift to messenger chats has been great but we also need to brainstorm and get our ideas together.  At times we will not be talking from the same page.,,,,,,,
4,"We have a shared goal of identifying a useful project to which we can dedicate ourselves. However, this idea is only beginning to coalesce, so until now there has not been anything concrete.",,2,2,,We are on the same page in terms of understanding the complexity of our problem and doubting the role we can play within it. But everyone is dedicated to gathering useful information.,"We need to meet outside of class more. Thursday is a strange day to have deliverables due, because it is at the end of the week (things tend to get pushed to towards the end) but also Friday's are essentially the end of the week. It has been difficult to coordinate all members of the team, especially since Erika seemed unable to meet, but now that she has dropped I think scheduling should go much better.","Carve out times to meet up and have constructive discussions and flipchart exercises, and begin trusting our own perspectives more in order to identify a tangible, useful problem.",,,,,,,
4,"I think so; even though the problem has a wide range of potential solutions, I think the team has a shared goal of proposing a final solution ",,,,,"Good communication, task allocation, discussion, cooperation","Nothing within the team except sometimes the presentations are rushed; however, the sponsor seems to be taking a greater role than expected",Start working on presentations earlier,,,,,,,
4,"The people we are interested in helping through our project are low-income or homeless folks, and the problem scope lies in the realm of providing housing or services to obtain housing. We are still undecided as to which pathway to proceed in achieving that goal - this might be through affordable ADUs, or helping establish a network for community organizations like BACS.",,,,,We all care deeply about the problem and get along with each other. We're generally good at communicating and have not run into major disagreements.,"We're a little uncertain about how to narrow our scope and pin down a problem to solve. I think we're not really interested in the original problem statement - which was equivalent, in our eyes, to doing market research for Dragonfly. Thus, we have been wandering around the realm of housing and ADUs, trying to find a problem. Additionally, I don't think the work has been distributed equally thus far, but I anticipate that changing soon. ",I think we should communicate more often and make more efforts to split the work up evenly. ,,,,,,,
5,"No, team is frustrated with defining the problem.",,1,1,,We have fun,More commitment,Prioritize the course and apply the course methodology,,,,,,,
5,Yes. To improve the public transportation system such that more people are motivated to use it and more frequently. ,,,,,The diversity of opinion stemming from a diversity I'm backgrounds and majors helps is put a lot of perspectives on the table and modify directions based on them,Progress is relatively slow. Could be much faster.,Have a more defined timeline or project plan to accelerate process,,,,,,,
5,I am not sure,,,,,Everybody is friendly,Coordinating our work. Going to the group meeting.,Having roadmaps before the group meetings. Discussion about our interviews together.,,,,,,,
5,Yes. To find whether a problem statement given is an actually a problem or not.,,,,,"Not much actually. Everyone is not contributing to project. Further, all team members are not present for the weekly out of the class meetings.",Everyone contributing equally,Everyone should be present for the meetings so as to plan and execute activities for a week.,,,,,,,
5,Yes; reduce CO2 emission in the city of Berkeley,,,,,Each of us is coming from a very different background and we have a shared goal.,We can do better in communication.,Maintain constant and effective communication,,,,,,,
