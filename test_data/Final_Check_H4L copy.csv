3,Helping the community take charge of their health by organising community health innovation initiative,,3,4,,"Our team work, we always had productive discussions and were able to move forward by always listening to one another and reaching a consensus. We also had fun in this project and supported each other as a team",We could have worked in a more organised way. ,"For future teams, have a schedule that is flexible but consistent so that we can keep up with the work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,To improve the health of the community of South Berkeley,,,,,We worked best when communicating with each other face to face.,Remote communication.,Make sure that my group defines a mode of communication that works for all of us and shares our personal schedules with each other to make planning easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,Strategies to address and close long standing health disparities in South Berkeley,,,,,"We brought different personalities, skill set and strength to the task.  The team was able to leverage on each of these in pivoting, experimenting and developing solutions.","Meeting earlier and a bit more often earlier in the semester, so as to establish common understanding and make headway.",Be more pro-active in scheduling the meetings and make stronger nudges when pivoting is required.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"From the second check in until now, the shared goal was to get the project done.",,2,3,,I think we all took on individual responsibilities and completed that work well,I think a lot of things could have gone better. See my personal reflection for a glimpse into that. The cliche answer here is that we could have communicated better.,Come in with a fresh mindset whenever possible and make space to work out internal disagreeances.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,To complete our weekly deliverables and polish our mvp,,,,,Everyone was very dedicated to their individual tasks and completed everything they were asked to,"Our communication was pretty bad, that could have been much better ",Voice my opinion more often and push for more weekly team meetings ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Each member had two goals: an individual one and a shared one. Each individual goal was to focus the solution in a different way; and the shared goal was to incorporate everything together to deliver a coherent assignment for the class. ,,,,,Everyone approached the problem similarly: as novice in the startup and business domain; as believers that the problem of equitable development is possible to be solved.,"A dialog structure that allowed more time together. Although the curiosity and ingenuity of each member is amazing and it's awesome whenever we discuss, there were rarely such occasions. We are students and our activities are shaped more by our classes than self-motivation. An extra discussion session every week would have been great.","Schedule and enforce biweekly meetings. One for admin, one for ""inisght analysis,"" i.e. discussion. Also do activities where everyone lay out their own thought and each would analyze one another's POV to build understanding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"Yes, build a crowdsourcing platform to help community learn and participate in key development related decisions in Oakland",,,,,Clear understanding of what we are doing,More nuanced work towards the solution,1. set expectations right at the beginning and keep a periodic culture check-in. 2. Ask people's engagement and attention proportion for the project in their work life and set communications accordingly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,How we can launch the free buses initiative,,3,3,,Fun team,Better distribution of the work,Develop a better meeting agenda,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,Reduce the number of cars on the streets in Berkeley by bolstering public transportation,,,,,"Lean methodology, user testing",More contribution by certain members,Have more regular check in and evaluate contributions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"Yes, do your best for the project",,,,,We were friends,We could have work more,I will try to be more pragmatic about people work commitment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"Initially each team member has different perception of the problem, so we were not focused. By the end of the project, the team had shared goal of ""Free Buses in Berkeley"", hence everyone put efforts in the same direction.",,,,,"Team members stepped whenever needed, especially in the crucial last weeks. I got friends for life while working on this project.","Equal contribution/efforts from everyone. Having a big idea at the beginning of course, so that we could have spend more time making it more real than just turning in a plan.","Active engagement with teammates and faculty. Also, thinking big in the initial phase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,Implement the free bus initiative in the city of Berkeley,,,,,We stay focused at a shared goal and communicate well with each other,It would be better if we can contribute more time on the project,Make sure we have sufficient time for the project and communicate better with the team.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,Yes. To deliver a final product that we were all proud of.,,3,4,,"Once we pivoted and had a shared goal in mind, we divided up work extremely well.","The beginning stages of the project were difficult, interview burdens were not distributed evenly and presentations were not started until the last minute. ",Come together outside of class more to simply frame our thinking outside of the context of the project.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,Yes. The team wanted to come up with a solution that would make an impact on populations in need. The team decided to focus on homelessness and creating an empathy-building podcast and platform for direct action in the form of donations and personal conversations with homeless individuals. ,,,,,I think everyone on the team was flexible and followed the process taught in class rather than trying to develop solutions immediately. No one's ideas dominated and there was very open communication on what each member wanted. ,"Sometimes communication was slow on online platforms, and the presentations were usually started late the day before they were due.","Be more proactive in setting deadlines, requiring communication from each member, and having frequent team meetings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,Our shared goal is to develop a podcast that will broadcast homeless people's in an effort to spark empathy and direct action.,,,,,"We get along, bounce ideas back and forth pretty well, and are comfortable with our roles.","As before, getting presentations and interviews done on time.",Communicate more clearly and perhaps make more use of Slack.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,our goal is to meet the weekly interviews goal (5 - 10). Update each other on our interview insights. ,,2,3,,"We came from very diverse back ground so we complement each other work. We all are very responsible on meeting the interviews target, writing up analysis, and prepare for presentation. We communicated effectively when we have to step out for a week. ",I think more face to face time to meet outside of class. Having a clear goals for when things need to be done. ,Decide team meetings time and deadlines. Create a space for reflection and updates.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,Yes! It was to create a lasting solution that had a significant impact,,,,,"Our team worked well in that we had a pretty balanced and complementary set of skills. We were all hard working, dedicated team members. We all respected each other and valued our commitment to each other and to the class as a whole. While we were at our best, we were very good at picking up for each other when one member had a particularly busy week. Towards the end, we always remained on the same page, and always kept trying, even when we felt burnt out.","We could have not gotten burnt out, but that's just a part of life. We could have been better at doing our interview analyses as soon as we did out interviews(me and Rafael specifically, Sarah was really good at that). We could have been more consistent.",I might be more organized right from the get go. Set times to meet up and discuss and go over details and lessons learned. I also might implement the Hippo method to make sure everything thing has a least one person in charg of it so nothing falls through the cracks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,"I think we did have a more or less shared goal for our work together, in terms of the product that we were designing.  However, we are less coordinated on whether we want to pursue this project past the semester, and for some time were a bit less coordinated on who were the potential beneficiaries we should be talking to.",,,,,I think our team got along pretty well and we were open with each other and willing to pick up each other's slack when some teammates' schedules got a little bit more hectic.,I think we could have held each other a bit more accountable to doing our part.  I primarily am referencing myself as I do realize I fell behind in the last few weeks.,I would probably do a lot more planning early on to make sure we allotted time to meet each week and in this way potentially hold each other accountable on making the progress we promised each other.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
