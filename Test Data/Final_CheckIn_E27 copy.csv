Starting out with social interaction, I think everyone was got a long very well and respected one another's opinions. Another thing that went well was our team's ability to efficiently and effectively complete tasks.

35,"Our shared goal was to create a quality product, whether it be our prototype, or poster, or lab results, as efficiently as possible.",,,,,I think especially towards the end our coordination and dedication to the project was remarkable; we really buckled down to make sure we were able to get the job done.,"One thing we could have done better was started to do our prototyping a lot earlier; the majority of the prototyping was done in the last few days before the showcase, which really strained our ability to run heat-tests on our prototype.","On future teams, I would encourage my teammates to begin prototyping a lot earlier so that we are able to, as far in advance as possible, make any necessary changes to the design. Prototyping doesn't always go according to plan, so accounting for that in the planning process would be a good thing to do."
35,,,,,,,,

38,For the most part we worked together to finish our project.,,,,,Having a working prototype.,More effort from other teammates.,Set expectations from the get go.
38,"Our team had the shared goal to work together and get work done. I don't think that we verbally stated it, but I think that a goal was for everyone to equally contribute to all assignmnets.",,,,,"I think that what went well when we all worked together was that everyone had different skills. So when it came down to doing a certain task, there was always someone who was knowledgable on the topic or who could do the task. When we all got together, I feel that work got done a lot faster than when we just messaged each other in the group chat.",I feel that what could have gone better was that we did not meet as much as we should have. Most of the work mostly fell on three group members.,I think that what I could do differently on future teams to make sure that things go better is to make sure that we have set times when we will be meeting to get work done. Setting clear deadlines to when assignments are due and actually abide by them. 
38,Creat an umbrella phone case that can turn to be in two set orientations and feel comfortable.,,,,,trading off work to be started by one reviewed by the other then refined by the last,participation by ALL members and not just 3. ,make sure everyones task is very clearly defined from the beginning
